# Only one hashtag here
## Two in here
### Three in here

* Point 1 made
* Point 2 made
* Point 3 made

Sorry, those were not numbered. Let's number them.

1) First point
2) Second point
3) Third point

Now that i know my basics. Let me program.

### Iris dataset

Let us look at the names of the variables in the dataset.

```{r}
df=data.frame(mtcars)

names(df)
```

This line is going to tell me the summary of those variable.

```{r}
summary(df)
```

Finally, a plot.

```{r}
plot(df,1)
```

was that awesome or what?
